E. Additional fees spreadsheet does not automatically calculate totals based on volumes.
  Manual calculation must be done to establish prices in the spreadsheet after extract. 
  Request to have these calculations done automatically (see report example ADDITIONAL FEES SPREADSHEET)

-Ans-->Additional fee Extract level changing totalcost=totalfee*volume

D. Current state “Additional Fees” extract does not show who requested the listed requests 
   so if there are errors or confusion surrounding a request it is not easy to determine
   who submitted the request to get clarity – asking there’s some sort of tracer on the report
   of who submitted (see report example ADDITIONAL FEES SPREADSHEET)

ANS--->Enteredby=employeedID

F. Current state “Print Extract” the only way you can tell what is being requested is the
  item will be listed in bold making it hard to truly tell what is being requested –
  if this can be enhanced or updated in someway the LOB would be appreciative 
 (see report example PRINT EXTRACT 9 PAGES for only one line of edits)

ANS-->changelog table level maintain the information to 9 pages for only one line

B. Currently there is no validation of criteria entered into form “new analysis account”
  for Acct Number – if this number is entered wrong it cannot be edited – LOB asking for some
 form of validation based on ACCOUNT NUMBER entered or a way to go back and edit once form has been submitted

ANS-->we are working Account Number validation 

A. Analysis Account List shows a listing of all analysis customers but is not used –
   Analysis Account Lookup is used – not necessarily an enhancement but is noted that the analysis
   account list is not a useful function

ANS--> we are Analysis Account Lookup working in this functionality
